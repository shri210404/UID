<h1 style="color: white">HACKATHONS</h1>

<h3 style="color: white">
A hackathon is an event that brings together experts and creates a collaborative environment for solving a 
certain problem. While the majority of hackathons revolve around computer programming and IT, many other industries 
follow suit. Today, it's possible to find HR hackathons, economics hackathons, music hackathons, and the like.

The word hackathon is a combination of "hack" and "marathon." So, essentially it's a marathon for hackers. 
 But, in this case, hackers are exploratory computer programmers.

The first hackathon dates back to June 1999 when OpenBSD brought together ten software developers who worked on 
cryptographic software.

Modern hackathons appeal to sponsors, partners, and recruiters. Besides working on a solution, 
hackathon participants join workshops, make presentations, interact with sponsors, communicate with recruiters,
 and much more.</h3>

<h3 style="color: white">
For participants, both online and offline hackathon structure is usually straightforward. Even when newcomers 
don't have a clear idea of what happens at a hackathon, they get used to the format quickly.

<h3 style="color: white">In short, hackathons work by bringing talent together to work on a mutual problem. The organizer arranges a 
helpful, relaxing, and productive environment for effective collaboration and competition. Meanwhile,
 participants take advantage of the format to find solutions, learn, network, and discover better career 
opportunities.
