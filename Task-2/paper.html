<h2> 
Paper presentation plays an extravagant role in the student's life. There are many advantages of presenting a
 paper. Presenting a paper is very difficult but in the end seems to be very simple and easy. To present a paper
 we need to have maximum of two or three participants and each and every participant will be awarded with a 
certificate. Paper presentation is part of technical fest in every engineering college. Presenting paper in 
universities like IIT, BITS and NIT will add a lot of significance to the resume. It is not only adding value 
to the resume but also helps in developing various skills. To present a paper an abstract must be submitted on 
a predefined topic.</h2>


<br>
<h1><u>abstract</h1></u>
<h2>
Abstract is soft copy which has to be submitted to the event organizer and few reputed colleges will ask 
for abstract well in advance and select best among the best. When it is asked to send early you must be more 
careful. Abstract is providing basic details about the participant like full name, phone number, email address,
 city, college detail, branch and place you reside. Be careful while entering your name because that will printed 
in certificate as it is. Abstract is the elaborate explanation of the topic and based on which you can prepare a 
power point presentation. Based on the quality of abstract you might be selected to present a paper.</h2>

Rules for a better abstract :

<br>

Abstract should be atleast minimum 5 to 6 pages and can exceed maximum to 7 to 8 pages. The personal details
 of participants must be less than 200 words and it must include the following data given below:
<ul>
<li>Full Name of the participant</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Course (Group) and College.</li>
<li>City</li>
</ul>

<br>
The font type of the abstract should be in Times New Roman and the font size must be 10. The complete abstract
 must be in written in bold and italic text so that it look more effective and it is also compulsory to do so. 
Every heading must be given roman no like Heading I, Heading II, Heading III, Heading IV and so on. Each and 
every word in the heading must start with capital letter. Sub heading in bullet points. Your abstract must be 
in two column format and can acquire this setting in MS word, page layout and make changes in column format. 
The margins must be set as default. Don't insert any picture in abstract as it is not allowed. Send the abstract 
to their mail id if they ask for a soft copy. Do not copy the matter from any site directly because copied 
abstract might be refused. Carry two hard copies of abstract as it will be asked by the judges and soft copy 
of abstract in either pen drive or CD.

<br>

<u>Power point presentation</u>

<br>

This is the most important part of the paper presentation. Your presentation skills will judge your creativity
 and talent. Pick up a rare topic, gather lots of matter and prepare best abstract. Based on that abstract 
prepare a PPT and it should consist 19 to 25 slides. The starting of the PPT must be welcome slides and followed 
by matter, the last but one slide is any question and last slides must be thank you. The most important thing 
that the participant must keep in mind is time limit. It is 8 + 2 minutes and bell will be given after half time 
is over. The additional 2 minutes are allotted for questions. The font size must be in between 18 to 28 as not 
everyone sight is good. Don't forget that a better speaker and good presentation can make a boring topic very 
interesting. So always make your slides better and better by following all rules and regulations. Always have
 speech written on notepad that makes your work simpler. Keep only one image for one slides or one image in an 
alternating slide as we know too many images spoils the presentations.
